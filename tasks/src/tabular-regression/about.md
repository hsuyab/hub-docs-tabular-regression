## About the Task

Tabular regression is the task of predicting a numerical value given a set of attributes/features. *Tabular* meaning that data is stored in a table (like an excel sheet), and each sample is contained in its own row. The features used to predict our target can be both numerical and categorical. However, including categorical features often requires additional preprocessing/feature engineering (a few models do accept categorical features directly, like [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/)). An example of tabular regression would be predicting the weight of a fish given its' species and length.

## Use Cases
Tabular data is one of the most prevalent data out there, and many raw-datasets once we extract features from them can be arrange in tabular form. Below you can find some of the popular tabular use-cases:-

- **Preditcting a continuous target value**: 
  When the data has been shared to us as a table, say in a spreadsheet in this case we can use the set of attributes/features to predict our target. Some popular examples like, predicting Taxi Fare based on distance traveled and time taken, predicting the Price of House based on number of rooms, square ft. area,  etc.

- **Time Series Forecasting**:
  Almost all time series forecasting problems can be solved as a tabular regression problem. Popular examples could be predicting the temperature next day, forecasting the Sales of a store across time.

- **Filling Missing Values**:
  This would be a little different from above examples however, suppose you have a table of data with some values that missing across multiple columns and rows. Here the challenge we address is of filling in those missing values.
